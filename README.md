# Frontend Mentor - Social Proof Section (Tailwind + React)

This is a solution to the [Social Proof Section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). I built this using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to practice utility-first styling for the first time.

## 🛠️ Built With

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (for faster development)
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Semantic HTML

## 💡 What I Learned

This was my **first Tailwind CSS project**, and I'm proud I replicated the original design precisely.  
Although the challenge was simple, it helped me focus fully on learning Tailwind’s utility classes, spacing system, and responsive tools.

## 📈 What I'd Do Differently

Next time, I’ll aim for more reusable components and possibly explore using Tailwind plugins or custom configs.
